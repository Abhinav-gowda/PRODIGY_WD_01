## Features ‚ú®

-   **Scroll-based Navbar Styling**: The navigation bar changes style when the user scrolls past a certain threshold, enhancing visual feedback.
-   **Scroll Progress Indicator**: A thin progress bar at the top visually indicates how much of the page has been scrolled, improving user orientation.
-   **Smooth Scroll Navigation**: Clicking on any menu item smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section, providing a seamless user experience.
-   **Responsive Mobile Menu**: A hamburger menu appears on smaller screens and toggles the navigation links, ensuring usability on all devices.
-   **Active Link Highlighting**: The currently viewed section is automatically detected, and the corresponding nav link is highlighted, improving navigation clarity.
-   **Ripple Hover Effects**: Subtle ripple animation effect on nav link hover for enhanced interactivity, adding a touch of elegance.
-   **Parallax Hero Section**: The hero section subtly moves with scroll for a parallax-like effect, creating a visually engaging introduction.
-   **CSS Animations**: Animations enhance user engagement without compromising performance, adding subtle but effective visual cues.
-   **Modern Design**: Incorporates gradients, glassmorphism, and box shadows for a visually appealing UI, reflecting current design trends.

## Tech Stack üíª

-   **HTML5**: Semantic and accessible markup.
-   **CSS3**: Flexbox, Grid, gradients, media queries, transitions, and animations.

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Abhinav-gowda/PRODIGY_WD_01.git
    ```

2.  Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

## Usage üöÄ

The interactive navigation menu enhances user experience by providing:

-   Clear navigation to different sections of a webpage.
-   Visual feedback on the user's current position on the page.
-   A modern and responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.

Here's how you can customize the navigation menu:

-   Customize colors by modifying gradients or theme colors in the CSS.
-   Add or remove sections and update corresponding navigation links.
-   Replace icons with emojis, SVGs, or webfonts for a professional look.
-   Tweak animation durations, easing, or keyframes in the CSS or JS.

## How to Use üí°

1.  **Include the necessary files**: Ensure that `index.html` is correctly linked to any external CSS or JavaScript files (though all CSS and JS is embedded in the HTML in this project.)
2.  **Modify Content**: Update the content within each section (`hero`, `about`, `services`, `portfolio`, `contact`) to match your website's information.
3.  **Customize Styling**: Modify the CSS styles in the `<style>` tag within `index.html` to match your brand's design and color scheme.
4.  **Integrate into Existing Projects**: Copy the relevant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into your existing web project.

Here are some real-world use cases for the project:

*   **Single-page websites**: Provide smooth navigation to different sections of the page.
*   **Portfolio websites**: Showcase projects and skills with a visually appealing and interactive menu.
*   **Landing pages**: Guide visitors through key information and calls-to-action.
